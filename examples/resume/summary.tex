Repeat (Co-)Founder, CEO \& CTO. Proud polymath and autodidact. Most recently Founder \& CTO at Blockstars (previously Playpad / Drive.FM). Have grown Engineering, QA, and Ops departments from Zero to One in multiple startups in early hire, first employee, and founding roles. 15+ years of diverse engineering experience with specialties in low-level debugging, performance optimization, high-scalability architecture, management \& hiring, culture building, and leadership development.

I thrive on tackling the hardest problems - the ones others give up on. Credited author on multiple software- \& hardware-focused patent applications including acoustic echo detection / cancellation techniques, wearable devices, and more. PR contributor with successful merges to multiple large open source projects (e.g. React Native, node-webrtc, AudioKit). Equally comfortable operating in a command line interface environment or a GUI - fan of Vim, iTerm, and VS Code alike.  Not afraid to question, debug, and possibly repair the hardware if all other possiblities have been ruled out. Always interested in learning and improving - whether an entirely new framework or simply a small optimization to the development environment.
